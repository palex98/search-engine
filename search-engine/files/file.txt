Once this is called Node starts to read the file in the background, 
but it also keeps executing our program. That is, it will call the 
console.log('after calling readFile'); and will print that text to 
the console. Then, once the file has been read into memory, Node 
will run the function we provided to the readFile method and that 
will print the content of the file.
