To show how and why JWT are actually used, 
we will use a simple 3 entity example 
(see the below diagram). The entities 
in this example are the user, the application 
server, and the authentication server. 
The authentication server will provide the 
JWT to the user. With the JWT, the user can 
then safely communicate with the application.
